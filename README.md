by adding `ex_decisiv_api_client` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_decisiv_api_client](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_decisiv_api_client).

## Setup

### client name

Every request made to a service carries a special `User-Agent` header that looks like: `ExApiClient/0.1.0/client_name`. Each client is expected to set its `client_name` via:

```
config :ex_decisiv_api_client, client_name: "valentine"
```

### timeout

This library allows its users to specify a timeout for all its service calls by using a `timeout` setting. By default, the timeout is set to 500msecs.

```
config :ex_decisiv_api_client, timeout: 200
```
